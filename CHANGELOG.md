# Changelog

## \[1.2.0] - 2025-07-18

### Added

* Support for tab activation via anchor links (e.g., `#tab1`, `#tab2`) instead of URL query parameters.
* Dynamic tab switching based on the current URL hash.
* Automatic assignment of the `active` class to the corresponding tab navigation link when selected.
* Special handling for `#courseTabContent`, which maps to `#tab1` and triggers the correct tab and link state.

### Changed

* Internal mapping logic to allow flexibility between hash values and actual tab pane IDs.

### Fixed

* Navigation links now correctly generate `#tabX` anchors instead of `?tab=tabX` URLs.
