# Course Tabs Plugin for Moodle

## Overview

The **Course Tabs** plugin enhances the organization of Moodle courses by introducing a tabbed interface that improves navigation and user experience for both students and teachers.

While the Universe theme creates 5 tabs that can be displayed on the main course page, these tabs disappear when you open an activity or resource. This plugin resolves the issue by allowing you to create a block within any course page or activity/resource page. The block ensures that the tabs are always visible, providing consistent navigation throughout the course.

## Features

- Displays course content in an organized tabbed format.
- Ensures the tabs created by the Universe theme are always visible, even within course activities or resources.
- Easy to integrate and configure within Moodle.
- Supports multilingual environments with language files.

## Requirements

- **Moodle Version**: 3.9 or higher (minimum version `2020061500`).
- **Theme**: Requires the `theme_universe` plugin (any version).

## Installation

There are two ways to install the **Course Tabs** plugin:

### Method 1: Manual Installation

1. Download the plugin and extract the files.
2. Place the extracted folder (`coursetabs`) in the `/blocks` directory of your Moodle installation.
3. Log in to your Moodle site as an administrator.
4. Navigate to **Site administration > Notifications** to complete the installation process.

### Method 2: Install via ZIP File from Moodle Dashboard

1. Download the plugin ZIP file.
2. Log in to your Moodle site as an administrator.
3. Navigate to **Site administration > Plugins > Install plugins**.
4. Drag and drop the ZIP file into the file picker or click **Choose a file...** to upload the ZIP file.
5. Click **Install plugin from ZIP file**.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
7. After installation, go to **Site administration > Notifications** to finalize the process.

## Customization

- The `styles` directory and `style.css` file are optional. By default, the plugin includes these files in an empty state. Users with CSS knowledge can modify the `style.css` file in the `styles` directory located directly within the plugin's directory to customize the plugin's appearance.  
  **Important:** Upon updating the plugin, the `style.css` file will be replaced or deleted. Be sure to back up the file before performing any updates.

- Alternatively, CSS customizations can be applied directly from the theme. In Moodle's frontend, the reference class for styling is `coursetabs-links`.

- Use the `lang` directory to add or update language support for the plugin.
